Code for Tensor-based Graph Learning with Consistency and Specificity

Some tips for implementation:

(1) We just provide a demo file on the HW dataset, you can replace other datasets to perform the examination.

(2) Our parameters are carefully tuned over the grid set {10^-3,10^-2,10^-1,1,10^1,10^2,10^3}.

Specificity for Multi-view Clustering"
